Introduction 
 
 
The profile of the Australian workforce has altered markedly since the end of World War 
II."
['Other'],"Australia has transform ed from a nation of predom inantly Anglo-Celtic culture and 
almost full em ployment to one of rich 
cultural diversity with relatively high 
unemployment."
"['Workforce Demographics', 'Women in the Workforce', 'Employment Shifts and Categories']","This report exam ines ways in which our workforce has changed, 
focusing on the f ollowing categories: women’s workforce participation rates, m igrant 
workers’ participation rates, e mployment categories, unemployment rates and 
demographic profiles."
['Other'],"This repor t will also consider n
ew influences affecting the 
workforce."
['Other'],"This report is an assessable com ponent of the Preparation for Tertiary Studies course at 
Victoria University of Technology, Werribee Campus."
['Other'],"1.1 
Methodology 
 
Information for this report was sourced from  various secondary sources, all listed in the 
Reference List."
['Other'],"Data from publications by the Australian Bureau of Statistics also proved 
valuable."
['Other'],"This report is not a comprehensiv
e review of  the ava ilable literature, but 
provides a broad overview of the topic."
['Other'],"1.2 
Scope of the report"
"['Workforce Demographics', 'Women in the Workforce']","Wherever the term ‘workforce’ on its own is u sed, it is in  reference to the Austr alian 
workforce."
['Other'],"Where the infor mation refers to a particular state, th is will be noted."
['Other'],"The 
period under consideration is 1945 to 2000, although where available data does not cover 
the entire period, this is stated."
['Other'],"The re
port focuses on several key aspects of the 
Australian workforce, and is  not a com prehensive account of al l changes that have 
occurred in the workforce since World War II."

Findings 
 
2.1 
Women’s Workforce Participation Rates"
"['Workforce Demographics', 'Women in the Workforce']","The overall participation rate of women in the Australian workforce since the end  
of World War II has increased markedly."
"['Workforce Demographics', 'Women in the Workforce']","The absence of male workers during the 
war ‘brought into the workforce considerable numbers of women who had not been 
employed before the war broke out’ (Ryan and Conlon 1989, p. 137)."
['Women in the Workforce'],"However, 
many women gave up their jobs when 
the men returned."
['Other'],"Their rates of pay 
compared to men were reduced in th e post-war years (Ryan and Conlon 1989, pp."
['Other'],140-144).
['Women in the Workforce'],"Edna Ryan and Anne Conlon provi de the following table, which shows 
that the proportion of women in the manufacturing industry peaked during the war, 
declined until 1959, and then began to increase gradually."

Over the next 29 years, cam paigns for equal pay (or at least for better than 75 per 
cent of the male rate for the same work) took place across many industries, and this 
was achieved in principle in 1974 (Ryan and Conlon 1989, ch. 6)."
"['Workforce Demographics', 'Women in the Workforce']","In 1945, 24 per cent of the workforce in Australia was women (Zajdow 1995, p. 3)."
['Other'],"By 1947, this had dropped back to 22.4 per cent."
['Other'],"In 1973, this had increased to 33 
per cent (Ryan and Conlon 1989, p. 174)."
['Other'],"In 1993, wom en made up 52 per cent of  
the workforce (Zajdow 1995, p. 3)."
"['Workforce Demographics', 'Women in the Workforce']",The increase in married women in the workforce has been particularly marked.
['Other'],"‘In 1947 only 15.3 per cent of wom en in the female labour force were 
married, or 3.4 per cent of the total labour force."
['Other'],"In 1971 56.8 per cent 
of women in the fem ale labour force were married, or 18 per cent of 
the total labour force.’"
['Other'],"(Ryan and Conlon 1989, p. 174)

Married women’s participation increased rapidly after 1971."
['Women in the Workforce'],"This is due, in part, to 
the fact that until the 1950s, women in government employment, including teachers 
and university staff, had been required to  leave their jobs upon m arrying."
['Women in the Workforce'],"In 1971, 
36 per cent of all m arried women were in paid work."
['Women in the Workforce'],"In 1995, 55 per cent of all 
married women were in paid work."
['Other'],"During this time, the proportion of men in paid 
work declined by 10 per cen t, and the proportion of un married women has stayed 
the same (Norris and Wooden 1996, p. 2)."
['Other'],"Much of the growth in wom en’s employment has occurred as wom en have moved 
from the ‘feminine’ careers of teaching a nd nursing into respectable ‘white collar’ 
industries such as banking and retailing (Game and Pringle 1983, p. 19)."
['Workforce Demographics'],"Participation in the workforce is uneven across different groups of wom en such as 
sole parents and Aboriginal and Torres St rait Islanders who have lower rates of  
participation."
['Other'],"However, the particip ation rate of women in general is higher now 
than at the conclusion of World War II (Zajdow 1995, p3; Ryan and Conlon 1989, 
p. 174)."
['Migrant Workers'],"2.2 
Migrant Workers’ Participation Rates 
 
The years since the end of the S
econd World War have seen an increase in 
immigration into Australia and therefore an increase in the num ber of migrants in 
the workforce."
['Other'],"Post-war Australia saw th e rapid national developm ent of projects 
such as the Snowy Mountains  Hydro-Electric Scheme."
['Other'],"This meant a great demand 
for labour, which the Australian workforce could not fulfil at the tim
e. Migrants 
were therefore encouraged to come to Australia to f
ill such jobs, res ulting in a  
period of high migrant employment (Carroll 1989, p. 48)."
['Other'],"Workers born overseas now constitute a s ubstantial proportion of the workforce; 
however, this group does suffer a high unemployment rate."
['Other'],"Some of the reasons for 
this include their lack of proficiency in English, the undervaluing or lack of
 
recognition of qualifications received overseas, the lack of a verifiable employment 
‘history’ with which to impress employers, discrimination and under-representation 
in trade unions (VandenHeuvel and Wooden 1996, pp. 7-8)."
['Other'],"All of these factors are 
more pronounced among non-English speaking background (NESB) women."
['Other'],"‘Prior to the 1980s, the convent
ional wisdom was that NESB 
immigrants, including wom en, had higher rates of labour force 
participation than their Australia- born counterparts… By the early 
1980s, however, this situation had dr
amatically altered, such that 
labour force participation rates of both NESB men and women now lie 
well below that of  Australia-born men and wom en.’"
['Other'],"(VandenHeuvel 
and Wooden 1996, p. 10)

The large increase in married women in the workforce applies only to Austra lia-
born women (a 14 per cent increase 
from 1980-94), and English-speaking 
background (ESB) migrants (a 9.7 per cen t increase)."
['Other'],"The proportion of m arried, 
NESB migrant women in the labour 
force dropped slightly over the period 
(VandenHeuvel and Wooden 1996, p. 10)."
['Other'],"Wo
rkforce participation for NESB 
women varies depending on their country of origin, but overall, their participation 
has decreased (VandenHeuvel and Wooden 1996, p. 11)."
['Other'],"Unemployment rates for NESB women show that in 1980 there was little difference 
from the unemployment rate of 7-8 per cent for women regardless of their country 
of birth (including Australia)."
['Other'],"By 1994, fi gures for Australia-born and ESB women 
were still at that level, while the ra te for NESB women had peaked at o ver 16 per 
cent in 1993 before falling to 15 per cent (VandenHeuvel and Wooden 1996, p. 15)."
['Migrant Workers'],"Post-war Australia saw a dramatic increa se in immigration; however, the migrant 
population does experience a high degree of
 unemployment and participation in 
lower-skilled jobs compared to people born in Australia."
"['Workforce Demographics', 'Employment Shifts and Categories']","2.3 
Employment Categories 
 
The major types of employm ent dominating the workforce at th e conclusion of 
World War Two differ greatly from  the categories of employm ent available in 
recent times."
['Other'],"After 1945, the Governm ent encouraged m anufacturing."
['Other'],"This was 
initially to provide employment for returned servicemen, then later to lower imports 
as a m eans to ease its balance o
f payment difficulties."
['Other'],"Rural ind ustries also 
prospered at this tim e due to a short supply of food and basic commodities in 
countries badly ravaged by the war."
['Other'],"By
 1950, 28 per cent of Australians were 
employed in secondary industries and 17 per cent in prim
ary industries (Carroll 
1989, p48)."
['Other'],The proportion of Australians employed in these areas has since fallen.
['Other'],"In the early 1970s, the governm ent reduced tariffs for primary exports in an effort 
to enter into trade agreem ents with Asian countries."
['Other'],"This w as followed soon after 
by a recession, and th e markets that the government had hoped to reach  with their 
manufactured goods dried up."
['Other'],"Australian ru ral and mining industries also suffered 
and this reduced em ployee numbers."
['Other'],"In the early 1980s, a severe drought and 
another economic slump once again reduced  employment opportunities in primary 
industries (Carroll 1989, p56)."
['Other'],"From 1970 to 1995, the percentage of the to
tal workforce engaged in agriculture 
and mining dropped from  9.6 per cent to 6 per cent."
['Other'],"The proportion of the 
workforce engaged in m anufacturing dropped from 24.5 per cent to 13.6 per cent."
['Other'],"The services industry, including occupati
ons like hairdressing,  entertainment, 
hospitality and tourism, has seen signif icant growth during the sam e period."
['Workforce Demographics'],"The 
proportion of the workforce engaged in services has increased from 47.8 per cent to 
65.7 per cent."
['Other'],"(Norris and W ooden 1996, p. 6)."
['Employment Shifts and Categories'],"See Appendix A for a fi ve-yearly 
breakdown of these shifts."

As the end of the cen tury drew closer, entirely new types of employment emerged 
and are still growing."
['Other'],"Many labour-intensive industrial jobs are now automated and 
performed by com puters, microprocessors or robots."
['Other'],"Inform ation technology is 
quickly becoming a growing area of em
ployment in Austra lia with m any jobs 
centred around the selling, servicing, pr
ogramming and operating of com puters 
(Carroll 1989, p. 56)."
['Other'],"The Australian workforce has gone from being largely based around manufacturing 
and exporting to being largely based around importing and consumerism."
['Unemployment Trends'],"2.4 
Unemployment and Demographic Rates 
 
Australia has experienced a dram atic increase in the rate o f unemployment since 
the end of World W ar Two."
['Unemployment Trends'],"At that tim e, and for approxim ately the next thirty 
years, unemployment was virtually non-exis tent and work was readily available 
(Carroll 1989, p. 48)."
['Other'],"In 1970, the unem
ployment rate was 1.5 per cent of the
 
labour force, and the underem ployment rate was less than 1 per cent (N orris and 
Wooden 1996, p. 8)."
['Other'],"Underemployment is defined as part-time workers who would 
prefer to work more hours and full-time workers who worked less than their usual 
hours for economic reasons."
['Other'],This is in contrast to current tr ends.
['Unemployment Trends'],"Between 1970 and 1995, underemploym ent 
rose fairly steadily to 7 per cent of the total labour force, while unemployment rose 
in three dramatic jumps in the mid-1970s (to 4 per cent), the early 1980s (to 9 pe r 
cent) and the early 1990s (to 10 per cent)."
['Unemployment Trends'],"The late 1980s saw the unemploym
ent 
rate drop back to less than 6 per cent and, after peaking again at over 10 per cent in 
the interim, in 1998, the unemployment rate had fallen to eight percent (Australian 
Bureau of Statistics 1999; Norris and Wooden 1996, p. 8)."
['Other'],"It is not uncommon for  
job seekers to be without em ployment for several years at a tim e."
['Unemployment Trends'],"In 1994, 35 per 
cent of unemployed people had experienced  long-term unemployment."
['Other'],"This rate  
has decreased since that tim
e (Norris and Wooden 1996, p. 9)."
['Unemployment Trends'],"A range of
 
demographic factors and indicators affects the current high rate of unemployment."
['Other'],"Several factors determine a person’s likel ihood of experiencing unem ployment in 
the current working clim ate."
['Other'],"These in clude socio-economic background, area of 
residence (rural versus urban areas), prof iciency in speaking English, age, and to a 
lesser degree, sex."
['Workforce Demographics'],"The following data was obtained by the Au
stralian Bureau of Statistics in  
September 1997, and pertains to job seekers nation wide."
['Other'],"At this tim e, an average 
of twenty-seven percent of job seekers from the lowest socio-economic background 
had not worked at all, com pared to seventeen percent of those from higher socio-
economic areas."
['Workforce Demographics'],"The proportion of job seekers that had not worked since May 1995 
was highest in m ajor urban areas (27 per cent) and lowest in rural areas (20 per 
cent)."
['Other'],"There is also a solid link betw een a person’s lack of proficiency in speaking 
 
 
Version 1.0

Research Report 
Page 8 
English and unem ployment."
['Other'],"Sixty one per cent of persons who do not speak
 
English proficiently or at all had been unemployed since 1995."
['Other'],"It also appears that 
the older a person is, the greater the chan ce of being unemployed for a long period 
of time."
['Other'],"Forty three per cent of job seekers between the ages of forty-five to fifty-
nine had not worked since May 1995."
['Other'],"Fifty per cent of these people reported that 
they were considered to be too old by employers."
"['Workforce Demographics', 'Women in the Workforce']","Virtually the same proportions of 
male and female job seekers were in stable em ployment at September 1997."
['Workforce Demographics'],"The 
only variation was that for males, this work was predominantly full-time, while for 
females, half were working part-time (Australian Bureau of Statistics 1997, p. 20)."
['Unemployment Trends'],"In a period of fifty-five
 years, Australian has tr ansformed from a nation of 
practically no unemployment to one of reasonably high unemployment with rather 
complex and varied causes."

3. 
Conclusion 
 
The Australian workforce has altered greatly in the fifty-five years since the end of World 
War II."
['Other'],"Many of these changes have  been very positive, such as the growth of women in 
the workforce, the formation of many new employment categories and the introduction of 
migration to cope with a tim e of great industrial growth, which has in turn enriched our  
culture."
['Other'],"There are, however, som e negative aspects associated with the transf ormation."
['Other'],"Many 
areas of employment have been replaced by m achinery or other technologies, displacing 
unskilled workers."
['Other'],"Consequently, Australian society is now experiencing a high dem and 
for a skilled labour force, and an increasing sector of the population without such skills is 
suffering long-term unemployment."
['Other'],"The change  experienced in such a relatively short 
period of time leads to the question: what do the next fifty-five years hold?"
['Other'],"4. 
Recommendation"
"['Workforce Demographics', 'Women in the Workforce', 'Employment Shifts and Categories']","The information collected for this report provides a broad overview of key changes in the 
Australian workforce."
['Other'],"Further analysis would be possible if the relevant data for each 
year from 1945-2000 was purchased from the Australian Bureau of Statistics."
['Other'],"The 
reliance on secondary sources has resulted in some patchy data."
"['Workforce Demographics', 'Employment Shifts and Categories']","For example, it is not 
possible to identify for any given year a breakdown of the Australian workforce by the 
following categories:  
• unmarried Australia-born women 
• married Australia-born women 
• unmarried Australia-born men 
• married Australia-born men 
• unmarried immigrant women 
• married immigrant women 
• unmarried immigrant men 
• married immigrant men 
 
Greater access to primary data would enable a more thorough analysis to be made."
